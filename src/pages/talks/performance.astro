        You have just delivered your new Hyv√§ shop. 
        On the test environment you had the magic 100 points in Pagespeed Insights, 
        but now a tag manager has been turned on, several extra third-party scripts have 
        been added and you see your score slowly drop and a slow site as a result. 
        How do you deal with thirt-party tags in a smart way and ensure that your 
        webshop remains super fast.
